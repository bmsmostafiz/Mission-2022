                <p>
                    Mission Ready was recommended to me by a colleague to do this as a stepping stone… It was a learning and work experience to get my foot into IT. I found out that I’m really good in the technical area. It gave me a hands on approach, more practical, good mentors, and also really interesting project sponsors.

                <p>
                    Research shows more than a third of Australian jobs face a significant risk of automation in the next one to two decades. However, there are some skills that will never be replaced by automation. It’s therefore become crucial to focus on future-proofing your career by honing these skills.

                    Time is of the essence. Young people need high-quality programming now more than ever. Your funders and partners are requesting your services. Now you must ensure that the teams on the ground have the knowledge and skills they need for successful implementation. Without a clear system of high-quality training and support, your youth-focused initiative may not sustain.
